# CET-MCA-S1-LAB

This repository contains all the lab cycles, I did during my first semester. The lab questions are divided into 4 cycles + 2 test cycles.

## Cycle-1

1. Write a  program in C to compute of an employee due to simple rates earned on amount Rs.500000 in a period of 10 years. Assume that the interest rate is 8% per year.
2. Write a  program  in C that accepts distance in inches and prints the value in centimetre.
3. Write a program in C that accepts the temperature in Fahrenheit and print the corresponding in Celsius.
4. Write a program in C to find the solution of aX 2+ bX + c = 0.
5. Write a program in C to convert any character into its ASCII code and viceversa.
6. Write a program in C to convert the lowercase letter in upper case and viceversa.
7. Write a program in C to swap two numbers and print the numbers before and after swapping.
8. Based on the guidelines ,sessional marks for awarding all theory subject for MCA curriculum. Prepare a progress sheet in C (using printf)  which contains marks scored by u for each subject  for the first series examination  and the subject total for sending to your parent’s address. Read  all relevant data from keyboard and display the progress sheet.Note:The marks for all subjects should be computed based on the guidelines (ie,out of 15 marks)

## Cycle-2

1. Print Square, Cube and Square Root of all Numbers from 1 to N using loop.
2. Read an integer number and check whether the entered number is Positive, Negative or Zerountil user does not want to exit.
3. Implement a Calculator . Read two integer numbers and an operator like +,-,*,/,% and thenprint the result according to given operator, it must be a complete calculator program onbasic arithmetic operators using switch statement in C.
4. Read an age of 5 person & find out how many of them fall under a category.
5. Implement a Login Authentication System.

## Cycle-3

1. Implement a Substring Extraction System. Input   a string from the user and extract thesubstring (a portion of the string). [Hint: To get the substring from the string, take  from andto (start and end) index of the inputted string ] using User Defined Function.
2. Read a value and print its corresponding percentage from 1% to 100% using recursion.
3. Demonstrate Different storage classes in C.

## Cycle-4

1. Given an array of size N consisting of integers. In addition to this you are given an elementM .Find and print the index of the last occurrence of this element M in the array if it existsin it, otherwise print -1. Consider this array to be 1 indexed.
2. Consider a scenario where a new deadly virus has infected a large population. A brilliantscientist has discovered a new strain of virus which can cure this disease. Vaccine producedfrom this virus has various strength depending on 'x_blood' count. A person is cured only if'x_blood' count in vaccine batch is more than 'x_blood' count of person. A doctor receives anew set of report which contains 'x_blood' count of each infected patient, P stores all vaccinedoctor has and their 'x_blood' count. You need to determine if doctor can save all patientswith the vaccines he has. The number of vaccines and patients are equal.
3. Implement a Video Library Management System.
4. Implement a Railway Reservation System.
5. nput a Student Academic Record (Name,Roll number,Marks of subject: MATHEMATICS,PROGRAMMING   IN   C,   DATA   STRUCTURES)   of   10   students     into   a   file“student_record”.

Note: To view the complete questions, refer the PDF documents present in corresponding cycle folders.
